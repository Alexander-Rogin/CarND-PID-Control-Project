## Reflections on PID coefficients

P coefficient (P stands for Proportional) is applied to the difference between the target position and the current (i.e. measured) one. This coefficient defines how agressively the vehicle will steer towards the target. The greater the cofficient is, the faster the vehicle will reach the target position and the more overshoot it will have. I ended up setting P coefficient to 0.15 which provided me with quite quick reaching the center position with slightly unsteady movement.

I coefficient (I stands for Integral) is applied to the accumulated error. When the error gets big enough, the integral part starts taking an effect. This allows the vehicle to overcome possible systematic bias. In my case, I set I coefficient to 0.0 because otherwise even small values had drastic effect of making the steering angle jump from +25 to -25 degrees without any values in between. I suppose that the error was accumulated very quickly and the integral part dominated the controller. The possible solution might be to reduce I coefficient even more (lower than 0.01) or to collect the error over only the last several steps.

D coefficient (D stands for differential) is applied to the difference between the current error and the error measured at the previous step. The idea of this part of the controller is to counter-steer when the vehicle gets closer to the target. This allows to reduce or completely remove oscillations caused by the P part. I set this parameter to 0.75.

All the coefficients in this project were set manually, by trial and error. First, I increased P until the car could reach the center fast. Then, I increased D to make the car move more steadily and avoid major oscillations. Increasing the I coefficient even slightly destroyed the achieved behavior utterly so I set it back to zero. At the end I adjusted P and D slightly to make the car go through especially sharp turns without leaving the track.

The final coefficient values let the vehicle to cover several laps on the track with the throttle of 0.3 achieving the maximum speed of about 32 kmph. There is still room for improvement due to car oscillations and jerky behavior when taking sharp turns.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
